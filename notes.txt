*Job
  -PID
  -arrival time
  -cpu bursts
  -I/O bursts
  -CPU wait time
  -I/O wait time
  -Finish time

*Job %d terminated: TAT = %d, Wait time = %d, I/O wait = %d

*The dispatcher in the real world is what determines where everything goes in a system.

*Clock ticks
  -If any resource is available -> do the assignment
  -Increment appropriate times

Need to add multiple CPUs and IOs to the main function and 
have it so that the proper algo can be passed in to the functon
as a variable currently it is hardcoded for RR

Things I need to complete:
1. Calculate turnaround time 
2. Calculate IO/CPU wait 
3. Add the ability to have multiple CPUs and IOs
4. Have the function take in number of CPUs Ios and 
what scheduling algo is being used 
5. Use his code to create a file to run
